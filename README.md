# Squad-Mortar-Calculator-IOS
IOS App: Mortar calculator for the video game Squad

There are a few websites out there with mortar calculators and even an android app but unfortunately there was no IOS app and many
people including myself wanted one so here it is! This is the first IOS app I have made and my first time using Swift or
Xcode so contributions are definitely welcome there is certainly a lot that can be improved on I am sure.

## Features
The application currently comes with 3 main features

### Calculate
The classic calculator.

This tab takes two inputs of mortar and target grids, and is capable of selecting sub-grid positions.

The calculator provides results for Distance, Azimuth and Milliradians.

### Correct
Adjust results.

This tab is used to correct the initial calculation if needed, it can be used to move the target an ammount of meters in any direction or simply add or subtract from the range.

This can be useful for when extra precision is required by the user.

### Barrage
Spread fire.

This tab is used to give regular calibrations to target points within a specified area.

This can be useful for when the user wishes to suppress an entire zone.

## How it works

Unfortunately there are no readily available 3d mapping of Squad maps so the formula that this and as far as I know all calculators use
is based on an interpolation of the provided figures for a 2d plane. There are many ways to accurately accomplish this interpolation and
I have taken the simple method of using a 12th order polynomial calculated by polynomial regression. The formula was calculated by
[PolySolve](http://www.arachnoid.com/polysolve) and provides a correlation coefficient of 0.9999994.

Fortunately user error is a far greater problem than error due to altitude differences as at all but extreme ranges mortars fall extremely
steeply mitigating the error. The formula itself is accurate to about Â±1 meter on a 2D plane, a value far smaller than the natural spread
of mortars.

The app calculates 3 values: Distance, Azimuth, and Milliradians. Firstly the app accepts input for grids of the form (A1-1-1) and converts
these grids into meters in the game's own coordinate system. The app also accepts subgrid input which has an effective accuracy of 1 pixel
on the user's screen.

After both the Mortar and Target positions are accepted and converted to meters in the XY plane, the distance and azimuth are found
by simple trigonometry. The milliradian value is then calculated from the meter value using the formula discussed previously. The precise
formula currently used for those interested is:
>
    func rads(distance: Double) -> Double {
        var rads:Double = 1603.9273942850821 // const from polynomial
        rads += -5.8438295306148713 * pow(10, -1) * distance
        rads += 2.3978428325334847 * pow(10, -3) * pow(distance, 2)
        rads += -1.6710022368637173 * pow(10, -5) * pow(distance, 3)
        rads += 6.8176342659639214 * pow(10, -8) * pow(distance, 4)
        rads += -1.7561870164951840 * pow(10, -10) * pow(distance, 5)
        rads += 2.7973321639240712 * pow(10, -13) * pow(distance, 6)
        rads += -2.2893211828988827 * pow(10, -16) * pow(distance, 7)
        rads += -2.7848767129442064 * pow(10, -20) * pow(distance, 8)
        rads += 2.7355539358279937 * pow(10, -22) * pow(distance, 9)
        rads += -2.8038885580479877 * pow(10, -25) * pow(distance, 10)
        rads += 1.2940370170642232 * pow(10, -28) * pow(distance, 11)
        rads += -2.3669421263783761 * pow(10, -32) * pow(distance, 12)

        return rads
    }
    
## Development

### Future Features
Features that will hopefully be added to the project:
- A map UI for input
- Accounting for height differences in calculations

### Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for considering contributing to the project, I am very much a beginner when it comes to swift so feedback and pull requests are
very much welcome. To report a bug or suggest a new feature simply open a new issue after making a
quick search to check a duplicate issue does not already exist.

For code contributions please first create an issue/comment on an issue stating you intend to try to tackle it. Then branch off the develop branch (fork if you like but it's not required), when you're ready open a Pull Request to the develop branch for review. Comments on issues and pull requests are also very much welcome.

Code requirements:
- Please leave comments on any code that isn't immediately obvious.
- Tests are not required as the entire project needs them currently.
- There is no particular syntax style guide.

The master branch is the current release and the develop branch is the next release.
