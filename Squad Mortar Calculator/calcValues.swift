/* James: Singleton to store calculator values that need to be shared between views. Singletons (effectively global variables) are somewhat
 of a tabboo in programming however any alternative data passing for the project seemed far more complex. The notification chains served for
 data passing in a tab, but passing data between tabs seemed nearly impossible without some form of global variable */
