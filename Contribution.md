Thank you for considering contributing to the project, I am very much a beginner when it comes to swift so feedback and pull requests are
very much welcome. To report a bug or suggest a new feature simply open a new issue after making a
quick search to check a duplicate issue does not already exist.

For code contributions please first create an issue/comment on an issue stating you intend to try to tackle it. Then branch off the develop branch (fork if you like but it's not required), when you're ready open a Pull Request to the develop branch for review. Comments on issues and pull requests are also very much welcome.

Code requirements:
- Please leave comments on any code that isn't immediately obvious.
- Tests are not required as the entire project needs them currently.
- The project conforms to the recommended style guide by tailor. Codacy will automatically comment on PRs if style changes are required

Linter:
As previously mentioned the project conforms to a style guide powered by tailor. Codacy will automatically comment on your PRs if changes are required but the lintor can be run automatically in Xcode to ease conformation. If you wish to accomplish this instructions on tailer xcode intergration is available [here](https://github.com/sleekbyte/tailor)



The master branch is the current release and the develop branch is the next release.
